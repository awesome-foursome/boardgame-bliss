				<h1>How To Pay Chess</h1>
				<p>Chess is won when your opponent is in check and cannot escape. That is called checkmate!
					Every square in chess has a name, with vertical files from a-h and horizontal ranks from 1-8.
					Check means that a king is being threatened. A king can never actually be captured, so the other
					side must get out of check by moving, blocking, or capturing the checking piece.</p>

			</div>

				<h1>How To Move The Pieces</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The King</h3>
				<p>The king can only move to any square that's directly next to it: up, down, sideways, or diagonal</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The Queen</h3>
				<p>The queen can move forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally like a king. However, unlike the
					king, the queen can move
					as far as it wants to in each of these directions but cant jump over other peices.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The Rook</h3>
				<p>The rook can move forwards, backward, and sideways as far as it wants but can't jump over other
					peices.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The Bishop</h3>
				<p>The bishop can move diagonally like a queen, but not forward, backward, or sideways. Each side starts
					with two bishops,
					one on a light square and one on a dark square and can only move on its allocated square color.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The Knight</h3>
				<p>The knight is the only chess piece that doesn't go in a straight line. The knight moves two squares
					in one direction and then turns
					and goes one square to the side. Usally he would move to a dark squre then to a light and so on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>The Pawn</h3>
				<p>Pawns move one square forward and cannot move back. A pawn may advance two squares on its first move.
					Pawns can only capture one square diagonally ahead.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h1>Additional Rules</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>Chessboard Setup</h3>
				<p>Rooks are in the corners, with knights next to them, followed by bishops. Kings and queens take the
					center squares with the
					queen on her own color. All pawns go on the 2nd and 7th ranks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="cards">
				<h3>Pawn Promotion</h3>
				<p>When a pawn reaches the end of the board it ‚Äúpromotes‚Äù, it turns into another piece. Most of the time
					players promote
					to a queen, but a rook, knight, or bishop is also possible but not a king.</p>
