## The Project

This page was designed for a user to be able to input the chess board state from games on Chess.com. The user then receives a suggested move and an indicator on the current state of the game as provided by the Stockfish Api. If the user is just starting out then they can access the rules page in order to receive a detailed breakdown on the obect of the game, how pieces move, other rules and introductory videos. 
Other features include:
- Saving various data to local storage for quick future access.
- An interactive GUI including modals, hover effects and themes.
- Disclaimers to prevent automatic access to sections of content.

Goals included, having pages function without errors, consistent appearance throughout and using a third party css library for the bulk of styling.

- Increased scope to add functionality for additional games.
- Additional pages and features.
- Trying to convert code to be uniform and follow best practices.

## Key Learnings

Other learnings include:
- Working in an Agile environment.
- Dealing with merge conflicts.
- Better understanding on which components of work impact others and how.
- Effective use of other team members existing code.
